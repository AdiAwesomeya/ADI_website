        <h3>My name is Aditya Purwar, and I am currently 11 years old. I am Indian, but I live in Singapore. 
        I go to NLCS Singapore. I have many hobbies, such as coding, music, and sport. I like learning a lot. I made this website so I can record my progress in
        coding and at the same time practice my website making skills. In my free time, I like to relax, game and play with my friends and family. I wish to
        be either a famous music composer, a spectacular game designer, or an amazing scientist. I have won may awards, such as passing with distinction & merit in 
        piano exams, getting first in a biology cell model competition, and getting in the top 20% of the world in a coding and logical reasoning competition.
